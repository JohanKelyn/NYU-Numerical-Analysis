# Numerical Methods I

This repository includes all material from my numerical methods class at NYU. This repository is part of a two-course series meant to introduce Ph.D. students in mathematics and computer science to the fundamentals of numerical mathematics. Every chapter will include a python notebook with theoretical material and examples done in python. Additionally, every algorithm and example is also done in Matlab. 

Topics Include:
* Systems of linear equations
* Overdetermined linear systems
* Singular Value Decomposition and Eigenvalue Problems
* Nonlinear equations and optimization
* Function approximation and interpolation in one dimension
* Numerical integration in one dimension

The theorical material and examples are taken from the following resources:
- L.N. Trefethen and D. Bau, III, Numerical Linear Algebra, SIAM (1997)
- E. Suli and D. Mayers, An Introduction to Numerical Analysis, Cambridge University Press (2003)
- P. Deuflhard and A. Hohmann, Nu- merical Analysis in Modern Scientific Computing, Springer-Verlag (2003).
- L.N. Trefethen, Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice, SIAM (2013)
- J.E. Dennis, Jr. and R.B. Schnabel, Numerical Methods for Unconstrained Optimization and Nonlin- ear Equations, SIAM (1996)
