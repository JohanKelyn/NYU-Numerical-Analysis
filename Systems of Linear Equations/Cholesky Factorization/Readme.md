# Cholesky Factorization

Hermitian positive definite matrices can be decomposed into triangular factors twice as quickly as general matrices. The standard algorithm for this, Cholesky factorization, is a variant of Gaussian elimination that operates on both the left and the right of the matrix at once, preserving and exploiting symmetry
