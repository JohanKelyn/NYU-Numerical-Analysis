# Conjugate Gradient

Conjugate Gradient (CG) is the most popular iterative method for solving large systems of linear equations. CG is very effective to solve system of equations in the form of Ax = b, where A has the property of being a symmetric matrix. These systems arise in many important settings, such as finite difference and finite element methods for solving partial differential equations, structural analysis, and circuit analysis.
