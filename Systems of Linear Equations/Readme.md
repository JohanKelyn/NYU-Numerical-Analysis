# System of Linear Equations

This chapter will focus into solving the system $$Ax = b$$. For this chapter, we are going to assume the following:

- $$A$$ is an $nxn$ matrix with $$a_{ij}$$ as its entry in row $$i$$ and column $$j$$ and $$b$$ a given column vector of size $n$ with jth entry bj;
- Our goal is to find a column vector $$x$$ of size $$n$$ such that $$Ax = b$$.
