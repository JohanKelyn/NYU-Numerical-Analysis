# System of Linear Equations

This chapter will focus into solving the system Ax = b. We cover different methods for solving this system. The methods covered in this section are:

- Gaussian Elimination
- LU factorisation
- Pivoting / PA = LU Factorization
- Cholesky Factorization for Symmetric Matrices

Each method will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using this method. Additionally, the number of calculations is discussed as well.
