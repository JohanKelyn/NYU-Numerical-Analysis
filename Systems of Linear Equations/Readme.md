# System of Linear Equations

This chapter focuses on solving the system <strong>Ax = b<\strong>. We cover different methods for solving this system. The methods covered in this section are:

- Gaussian Elimination
- LU factorisation
- Pivoting / PA = LU Factorization
- Cholesky Factorization for Symmetric Matrices

Each method will discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the number of calculations is discussed as well. Each notebook cover both theoretical material as well as examples for each method.
