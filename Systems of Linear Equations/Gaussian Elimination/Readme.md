# Gaussian Elimination

Gaussian elimination is a very familiar topic. It is the simplest way to solve linear systems of equations by hand, and also the standard method for solving them on computers. The goal of Gaussian Elimination is to solve the system of equations <strong>Ax = b</strong> by converting our matrix A into an upper-triangular matrix by applying simple linear transformations on the left. There are two methods to achieve this goal. The first one is LU Factorization and the second is a modification of LU Factozation using Pivoting also known as PA=LU Factorization.
